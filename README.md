# odin-recipes

This is the first project of The Odin Project.

I have created a simple recipe website consisting of four pages: a homepage and three recipe pages.
The homepage contains a header and links to each of the recipe pages.
Each recipe page has a header, photo of the dish, and sections for a description, ingredients and steps.
Each of the recipe pages has a link to take you back to the homepage.

This project has demonstrated my ability to create simple webpages using HTML.
